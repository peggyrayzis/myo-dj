Introducing Myo.DJ! Myo.DJ is a cool app that controls Traktor DJ software with Myo, a gesture control wristband.

Myo.DJ can be used with other DJ software too, as long as the key bindings are the same. You can adjust the robot keytap "x" in index.js for whatever key bindings you currently have.

Poses:
Wave In - Play Deck A
Wave Out - Play Deck B
Fist - Twist for Filter on Deck B
Fingers Spread - Twist for Filter on Deck A
Snap - Effect button 2 on/off
Double Tap - Effect button 3 on/off

1. npm install

Have fun! If you have any feedback or ideas for additional poses, please get in touch!
